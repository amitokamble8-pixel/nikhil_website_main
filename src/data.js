    "I'm a junior at Bergen County Academies in Rutherford, New Jersey, studying an all Honors, AP, and IB course load with a 4.0/4.0 cumulative GPA. My focus is computer science — machine learning, data structures, and full-stack development — alongside research that applies those tools to real healthcare problems.",
    "My research work centres on machine learning and reinforcement learning. I built a wearable diagnostic device for assessing Parkinsonian motor symptoms, and I'm assisting an NJIT professor on a reinforcement learning project involving machine learning implementations and experimentation.",
    "Outside the lab, I cofounded my school's Machine Learning Club to teach ML fundamentals to other students, compete in hackathons and game jams, and play alto and tenor saxophone in marching band, concert band, and the saxophone ensemble. I also teach summer band students and volunteer at a local senior center.",
